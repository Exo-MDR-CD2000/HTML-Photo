# HTML-Photo-Photography
A photography site to relearn the basics of CSS.

## Description

The goal was to stylize an existing HTML site using CSS following a few guidelines: 


- Use only external CSS file (no internal or inline styling)
- Every element must be styled.
- Create style rules using class, id, and element selectors.

A photography site was chosen for this assignment. The site behaves and looks well on desktop mode but mobile view was not prioritized. Most of the CSS selectors used to target HTML elements have comments describing what each CSS property does. A normalized CSS file was included to provide a baseline stylesheet for browser compatability. A user baseline stylesheet was then made followed by individual stylesheets for some of the various HTML pages. 

If given more time and more forethought, a mobile first approach would have been taken to ensure media queries were made.
