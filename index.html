    <h2> Welcome to my Photography Portfolio </h2>
    <p> As a novice photographer, I've included just a few of my shots within my gallery page. This serves as a proof of concept into using only HTML as a basis for a website.</p>
    <p> This site also serves to reinforce the concepts i've learned in the past and currently as a work in progress front end web developer.</p>
    <p> View my photo gallery page above using the navigation links.</p>
